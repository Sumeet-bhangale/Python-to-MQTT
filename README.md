# Python-to-MQTT

This repository contains a Python implementation for publishing messages and Subscribing messages to an MQTT broker. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol that is commonly used in IoT applications.

The implementation uses the Paho MQTT Python client library, which provides a simple API for connecting to an MQTT broker for publishing messages and  Subscribing messages. The code is organized into a single Python file that contains a class for managing the MQTT connection and a main function for publishing messages.

To use the implementation, simply modify the connection settings in the class constructor and call the main function with the desired topic and message. 

This implementation is useful for developers who need to integrate MQTT messaging into their Python applications. It can also serve as a starting point for more complex MQTT implementations that require additional features, such as subscribing to topics or implementing message persistence.

To get started, clone this repository and run the Python file with the appropriate arguments. The code is provided under an open-source license, so feel free to modify and use it in your own projects. Any contributions or feedback are welcome!
